# Infrastructure Business

This section implements our actual business logic such as manipulating internal and external data by accessing Repositories and Data Providers.

This project should reference Application Interfaces & Models as well as Domain Interfaces & Models as it is the logic that binds the two layers together.

This project should avoid external references that are not required for business logic.
