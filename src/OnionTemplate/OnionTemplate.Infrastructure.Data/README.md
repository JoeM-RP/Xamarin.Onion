# Infrastructure Data

This section implements our Data Access layer. This is where our Repositories interact with storage, and our Data Providers interact with their external tools or APIs.

This project references Domain Interfaces & Models but should not reference any other project in the solution.

This project can however use any external package or reference it needs to access Third Party data for things like cloud storage, APIs, payment gateways, or anything else.
